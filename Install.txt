This is a Work In Progress so there are still parts that are not fully implimented or need cleaning up.

Undestanding everything will require reading through all the files.



********* This Profile Requires Thrustmaster Combined Device to be Joystick 1 (See Notes Below) ***********



This was cobbled together from things I found on the web so I could make the warthog work in Star Sitizen
and eventually map more commands out easily.

3 Modes are selected with Throttle Pinky Switch     (UMD)
2 Shift States Selected with Stick S4               (IO)


Controller Button and Hat Key Maps are Mapped to (IOUMD) Mapping

Most Things are mapped (MO) pinky switch middle Shift Out.

There are empty slots availible for mapping. Still testing what works best so things are open for sugestions.

This Script acts as a complete rebind of the Star Citizen Keymap using as mostly default Keys and adding Modifiers.
There are a couple unbound DX Buttons still availible for use.

Commands have keymap bindings in (SC_KeyMap_v3_11.ttm) and just need to be added to buttons in (SC_v3.11.0.tmc)
Some commands need to be verified still. 

** Controller Buttons with no command mapped do dot send any output to game when Pressed all commands are mapped in SC_v3.10.0.tmc **

All Controller Axis are now saved in layout_SC_3_11_Advanced_Warthog.xml
Edit XML to change this setting now. (Can be rebound in game)


To get Raw Game Binding XML I Recommend :
https://github.com/SCToolsfactory/SCJMapper-V2

This is an awsome tool that has been around from the start and mad props that is is still updated when needed.
This has good joystick id tools and will grab and export all the default xml from the game.

** You should use a code editor with syntax highlighting set to "C or C++" for all the tmh and tmc files **
** Code Formatting sensitive people are going to be triggered. **

Script Files and uses are:

StarCitizen XML File. -> layout_SC_3_11_Advanced_Warthog.xml

Shortcuts are then mapped to Command Defines in -> SC_KeyMap_v3_11.tmh

Commands are bound to Controller in -> SC_v3.11.0.tmc

To remove all Conflicts this profile should be loaded after Loading all default controls in Game.

To maintain all functions Two Files Must Match

layout_SC_3_11_Advanced_Warthog.xml       (In Game Binding) ** Edit the XML do not rebind in game **
SC_KeyMap_v3_11.ttm                       (Binding Defines for Controls)

All edits to one must be matched in the other.



*** Not Needed any Longer *** Rudders are configured in SC_UserPrefs_v3_10.tmh

Thrustmaster Rudders and T1600 axis are passed through as additional devices in the event handler.
This lets other device axis be used without using 1 of the virtual 8 for the combined device.

SC 3.11 Binding Map Complete Table.pdf         There are too many bindings for the GUI to output now so this is a complete list

Section 2 Install
-----------------

1.  Extract Folder to known Directory
2.  Copy layout_SC_3_11_Advanced_Warthog.xml to your Star Citizen Controller Mappings Folder
3.  Edit SC_UserPrefs_v3_11.tmh (Defaults should work for most)
4.  Load SC_v3.11.0.tmc in target script editor and run
5.  Launch Star Citizen
6.  Load layout_SC_3_11_Advanced_Warthog.xml
7.  Bind All Controller Axis in Game (see Map in Section 3)(Default Binds added to XML can skip)
8.  Go Fly

Section 3 Notes
---------------

This Profile will only work when the Combined Device is Joy1.
3dConnexion Space Mouse Always Grabs ID1 for example (may require driver removal)


To Try and reset the Joy Id to #1

(USB Hubs have issuse that cause them to not reset using this method sometimes.)

If Windows Resets the Controller ID (Unplug all controllers, Reboot, Plug controllers back in starting with the Stick 
then Throttle and finally Pedals if used, but CHANGE THE USB PORT THE DEVICE PLUGS INTO, 
if ports are in groups try a different group of ports for each controller.)

As a last resort (Unplug all Controllers, then plug in the Stick and Throttle, Start and run the script editor, Then Plug in additional controllers)
This will force Joy1 to set correct.

or the Voodoo Option (pp_resortdevices joystick 1 2)

SC_KeyMap_v3_10.ttm can be imported into the target GUI and used to map shortcuts and Print SC_KeyMap
SC_KeyMap_v3_10.ttm can also be Imported In GUI and used to map key binds if you wanted to not run full script
Doing this will give you the full List of Commands listed in groups.

To Rebind Controls open SC_v3.11.0.tmc find the control you want to change and replace with new Define from SC_KeyMap_v3_11.ttm

*** Mapping ***

Right Throttle with Boat switch in (Middle) position should be bound Throttle Forward
Right Throttle with Boat switch in (Forward) position should be bound Throttle Forward/Back

Left Throttle should be bound Speed Limiter ABS

Throttle Mouse Axis should be bound to Strafe up/down and left/right

Throttle Slider to Increase/Decrease Mining Laser Power
